##REST## is a style of architecture, which provides definitions for resources, and for the actions which can be done to them. 
When applied to the web, pages and their content are the resources, which can then be better served at scale between different machines and networks. It allows for large amounts of data to be read and presented more automatically. REST works with CRUD actions, called:

- POST (create)
- GET (read)
- PUT (update, replacing the existing value)
- PATCH (update, modifying the existing value) (not sure of the difference here)
- DELETE (delete)
